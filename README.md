# OpenProfile.ai
### A shared context layer for personalized AI, built on facts — not guesses.

## 🌐 Concept

**OpenProfile.ai** is not a product or protocol — it’s a **paradigm shift** in how AI systems understand users across digital ecosystems.

Born at the intersection of:
- **Schema.org** — structured, machine-readable data for the web  
- **MCP** — as a transport model for interoperability  
- **Solid Project** — as an ideological backbone for decentralized, user-owned data  

OpenProfile proposes a **decentralized context layer**, where people can share curated facts about themselves  
(e.g., what they own, what they enjoy, what they believe in)  
with the websites and AI assistants they trust — **without sacrificing privacy or control**.


## 🤖 Why Now?

AI systems — from recommendation engines to shopping assistants — suffer from:
- ❄️ Cold starts  
- 🧩 Lack of user context  
- 💸 Expensive training with sparse data  

Brands spend millions training models that **barely know their users**.  
We believe the missing link isn’t *more* data — it’s **better access to user-declared facts**,  
safely shared through a trust-based model.

**OpenProfile.ai** is an invitation to rethink identity, context, and preference in the age of AI.
